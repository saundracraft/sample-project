# hello-world-bot
A template for creating a Twitter bot that tweets lines of a text one at a time.

This is a template for the Build-a-Bot workshop at PyDX Conf 2015 in Portland, OR.

(or whoever happens to want to make their own Twitter bot for the first time)

You'll need to add a text file to book.txt and a secrets.py file that contains a consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_key, and access_secret for authorization with Twitter.

Detailed setup instructions are at https://tpinecone.gitbooks.io/build-a-bot-workshop/content/
